# WhatsApp-group-chat-analysis

The Young Data Professionals WhatsApp group is my favorite corner for fun, enlightenment, learning and improving my skills. YDP is like an online family house for
young enthusiastic data professionals where ideas are shared. I was opportuned to join the group on 10th of May, 2022. I decided to analyze the group chat data, before the cleaning and analysis process I had so much hope it is going to be a fun project and I am going to learn alot.
