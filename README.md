# WhatsApp-group-chat-analysis

The Young Data Professionals WhatsApp group is my favorite corner for fun, enlightenment, learning and improving my skills. YDP is like an online family house for
young enthusiastic data professionals where ideas are shared. I was opportuned to join the group on 10th of May, 2022. I decided to analyze the group chat data, before the cleaning and analysis process I had so much hope it is going to be a fun project and I am going to learn alot. 

I was so curious to know;

The most active member of the group from 10th of May,2022 to 10th of September,2022.

Number of members that joined and those that were removed from 10th of May,2022 to 10th of September,2022.

Total number of messages sent.

Messages sent for each day and various time range.
